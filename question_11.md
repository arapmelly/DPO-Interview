### Describe how you would design an auto-scaling setup in AWS to handle a PHP application with fluctuating traffic. What services and features would you use, and provide a high-level architecture diagram if possible.

1.  **Amazon EC2 Instances**: These are the compute resources where your PHP application will run. 
2.  **Elastic Load Balancer**: To distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances
3.  **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**: The ASG dynamically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on traffic. When demand increases, it scales out by launching new instances. When traffic decreases, it scales in by terminating instances.  
4.  **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)**: For database needs. It provides managed MySQL, PostgreSQL, or other database engines. Decouple the database from the application servers to ensure scalability. 
5.  **Amazon CloudWatch**: Monitor performance metrics such as CPU utilization, memory, and network traffic. Set up alarms to trigger scaling actions based on thresholds.
    
6.  **Scaling Policies**:
    
    -   **Target Tracking Scaling Policy**: Adjusts the desired capacity of the ASG based on a target metric (e.g., CPU utilization).
    -   **Simple Scaling Policy**: Adds or removes instances based on specific conditions (e.g., increase by 2 instances if CPU > 70%).
7.  **Launch Configuration**: Define the instance type, AMI, security groups, and other settings for new instances launched by the ASG.
    
8.  **Security Groups**: Control inbound and outbound traffic to instances. Configure them to allow traffic from the ELB and other necessary sources.
    
9.  **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**: Create a VPC with public and private subnets. Place the ELB in the public subnet and EC2 instances in the private subnet.
    
10.  **Route 53**: Set up DNS records to point to the ELB. 
    

Hereâ€™s a high-level architecture diagram:
