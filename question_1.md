 1. #### Explain the difference between single-quoted and double-quoted strings in PHP. Provide examples of when you would use each.

	 *Single-quoted:*
	    *PHP does not attempt to parse any special characters within it*

	     $name = 'John';
	     echo 'Hello, $name!'; // Output: Hello, $name!

	   *Double-quoted:*
		*PHP will parse them and replace variables with their values and also interpret escape sequences*
		
	    $name = 'John';
	    echo "Hello, $name!"; // Output: Hello, John!
